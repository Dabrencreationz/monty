Monty byte code files                                                             Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line.
                                         It's completely new but as usual, need to learn tye concept and master it well. Tasks are given as always, though it's a group project but my past experience with partners are not worth it, so I decided to stand alone on this particular project.
